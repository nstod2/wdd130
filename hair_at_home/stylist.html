                <h4>Meet our Stylist</h4>
                <p>Hi, my name is Richelle, creator of Hair At Home. I have been styling since I was very young.  I was styling personally before I was styling professionally.  With almost twenty years of experience, I have learned more than the fine art of creative hair design. I have attained the ability to perform the delicate balance of fulfilling each clientâ€™s individual styling desires needs. I have developed an attention to detail, thoughtful consideration, and deep sensitivity for each client.  This has allowed me to cultivated long-lasting relationships. I enjoy creating an atmosphere that is inviting and luxurious allowing each client to feel comfortable in a stress-free environment in the comfort of their own home. 
                I specialize in creative color design, haircutting including new and modern styles and techniques, versatile hair styles, special occasion updos, hair extensions, facial makeup, and hair removal. When I'm not working professionally, I may be found spending time with my husband and two adorable children.   I am a professional vocal performer in the process of recording some great material. I am always up for experiencing the next adventure in the mountains or getting my hands on a good book.  Being a stylist is my passion, but most people find I am passionate about everything I do!</p>
