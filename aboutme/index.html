    <h2>Nancy Stoddart</h2>
    <h2>Nance</h2>
    <p>My name is Nancy Stoddart.  I live in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
     I am married with five children ranging from sixteen to eight years old.  I am currently working 
     towards a BS in Software Development and hoping to graduate in the next two to three years.  I feel very blessed to 
    live in a time when online learning is an option.  The pathway program has provided me with the ability to go back
    to school when I could not have attended otherwise.</p>
    <p>I love reading, dancing, singing, crafts, playing the piano, cooking, hiking and visiting new places.  I love my family and 
        watching them grow and develop.  I am learning new things everyday as a mother.
        I can be found at any of my children's performances or tucked away in a corner in blissful silence with a good book or movie and chocolate.
    </p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ since I was eight. I am grateful for the peace and joy that the love of my 
        Savior has brought into my life. I don't have a favorite quote by our church leaders, but I love many quotes by church leaders.  One that I like is by our prophet, President
        Russell M Nelson.  He says, "When we love God with all our hearts, He turns our hearts to the well-being of others." I am so excited to be learning
       with all of you!</p>
